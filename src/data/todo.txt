James Robson, Christ in Islam (A. 197.)

O jurists, you have sat on the road of the life to come, but you have not walked so that you might reach it, nor have you allowed anyone to pass you to it.

O pravnici, sedite na putu ka budućem životu, ali ne hodate da biste ga dostigli, niti dozvoljavate da neko prođe.
