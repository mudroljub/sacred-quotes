----------
Hamza Yusuf, Walk on Water: The Wisdom of Jesus from Traditional Arabic Sources
----------

Do not, like lords, look at the faults of others. Rather, like servants, look at your own faults.

Work for God and not for your stomachs. Look at the birds: they rise up at dawn and enter into the evening having neither planted nor harvested, yet God provides for them.

Beware of the luxuries of this world, and fear them, for the luxuries of this world are filth in the sight of God.

It is of no use to know something if one does not act upon it. In truth, an abundance of knowledge only increases one in pride if one does not act accordingly.

Jesus said:
Love of this world is the source of every wrong action, and there is much harm in wealth.
They asked:
“What is its harm?”
Jesus replied:
“Its possessor is never safe from pride and arrogance.”
They said:
“What if he is free of those two? Is there still harm?”
Jesus responded:
“Yes, for by nurturing his wealth, he is diverted from the remembrance of God.”

Once Jesus and his disciples were outside the temple of Solomon. Disciples said:
“O Messiah of God, look at the House of God! What could be finer?”
Jesus replied:
“Amen. Amen. But I say to you that God will not leave one stone of this House standing. Indeed, God will destroy it because of the misdeeds of its people. God does not build anything of worth with gold or silver, nor stones. Righteous hearts are more beloved to God than these stones.”

Love of this world and love of the next world can never reside in the heart of a believer simultaneously, just as fire and water cannot be contained in a single vessel.

Woe to the possessor of this world, since he must die and leave the world behind. He places his hope in it and is deceived. He trusts it and is forsaken.

Do not grieve the Holy Spirit which is in you, and do not extinguish the light which shines in you.

Ne ožalosti duha svetoga u tebi i ne gasi svetlost koja blista u tebi.

Blessed is he who has crucified the world and who has not allowed the world to crucify him.
